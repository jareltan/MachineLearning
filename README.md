In this Kaggle competition, given 5 years of store-item sales data, we are asked to predict 3 months of sales for 50 different items at 10 different stores. The motivation is to find the best forecasting model to predict the store-item demand.

My contributions for this project mainly inlcude the forcasting using LightGBM and also the integration of a meta model, which uses lightGBM to get a better SMAPE score from the predictions of a few models.
